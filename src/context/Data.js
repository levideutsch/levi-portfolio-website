                              I decided to create a backend version for owners of Airbnb properties to list their homes. Using React and JSON Server,
                              the project allows users to display their properties, set some as listed and others as unlisted. Additionally, 
                              it includes functionality to filter listings by name and distance, providing a comprehensive tool for property owners to manage
                              their listings effectively`,
